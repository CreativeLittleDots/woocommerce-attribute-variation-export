## WooCommerce Attribute Variation Export

WooCommerce Attribute Variation Export extends WooCommerce and allows the exportation of attributes from Variable Products.

When it comes to importing and exporting anything to do with Products, WooCommerce has most of it covered with [Product CSV Import Suite](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/).

However there is one thing missing, before you can even think about importing variations using Product CSV Import Suite, you need to create a CSV with all of the desired combinations of attributes that define your variations.

This is WooCommerce Attribute Variation Export, you can freely build your attributes and then export the possible combinations of your choice.
